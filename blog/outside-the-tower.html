        </div>

        <p>She leaned on the ledge of her tower window, letting the moonlight strike her face. She wore a black travel
            cloak, he
            wore red. Like a deck of cards. She dangled.</p>
        <p>“I don't know if this is a good idea,” he said, not wanting to startle her when she was so close to the edge.
        </p>
        <p>She smiled. “I knew you were going to say that.”</p>
        <p>She stepped up, balancing, feeling the wind as she looked out over the hundred feet below. The vertigo made
            her head
            spin but she didn't step away. It was pleasant.</p>
        <p>Her cloak billowed around her with the updraft.</p>
        <p>She'd been waiting for this, for so very long.</p>
        <p>She ruffled her long, frizzy hair. It was still itching from the last cut. She allowed herself one last look
            down
            &#8211; one final case of butterflies to be let loose &#8211; and then she stepped away to get the rope.</p>
        <p>“I'm tired,” he said. “Can't this wait until tomorrow?”</p>
        <p>“Not unless there's another full moon tomorrow,” she said, not looking at him. “Now shut up and help me,
            we've only
            got a few hours before sunrise.”</p>
        <p>Rapunzel had stopped questioning a lot of things since she'd been locked in the tower as a little girl. Most
            things
            she'd had enough time to think about, and had come to her own conclusions.</p>
        <p>One. Why her father would want to do this to her. Answer: Because he was a monster, and he couldn't see
            beyond his
            own paranoia and his war games to realise she wasn't just a trinket to be locked away for safekeeping.</p>
        <p>Two. How she had to managed to, over 12 years, pierce the magical shields around the tower. Answer: The magic
            of the
            Royal Family of Camelot must also flow, by extension, through her. Perhaps if she'd been given given some
            books on
            the subject, she'd have pierced it faster.</p>
        <p>Three. How to braid rope out of hair. Answer: Desperation.</p>
        <p>But there were some things she had no idea about. And, with no new input, she had simply stopped asking. So
            as Tom
            Thumb helped her anchor the long length of hair rope to the fireplace and carry it to the window, she didn't
            wonder
            how her imaginary friend was capable of doing this. He simply did.</p>
        <p>“I'm scared,” he said.</p>
        <p>She grinned. “Me too.”</p>
        <p>“I know,” he said. “That's why I'm scared.”</p>
        <p>She stuck her tongue out as she tied a sturdy knot around her waist. “By God, Tom. Grass.”</p>
        <p>“You've said.”</p>
        <p>“To feel it under my feet again,” she stared up at the moon out her window.</p>
        <p>“Well. Count your stars. I've never felt it,” Tom said. “Though apparently it's always greener on the other
            side.”
        </p>
        <p>Rapunzel narrowed her brow. “You are cheapening the most important moment of my life.”</p>
        <p>“Sorry, sorry,” Tom said. He took hold of the rope near where it tied her. “I'll foot you.”</p>
        <p>Slipping off her shoes &#8211; her toes would grip the stonework of the wall better, and she wanted to touch
            down on
            her bare feet &#8211; she stepped up to the edge. Backwards. A faith exercise.</p>
        <p>“Moment of truth,” she said, closing her eyes and exhaling. “Don't drop me.”</p>
        <p>He nodded, and she jumped.</p>
        <p>The rope went taught, and she squealed as with a thump, her feet clung to the side of the building. Then she
            laughed.
            She didn't know why she was laughing &#8211; nerves maybe, or gravity tickling at her.</p>
        <p>“I'm ok!” she shouted, more for herself than for Tom. She didn't hear a response.</p>
        <p>On three, she jumped again, and Tom slackened off more rope. She abseiled another ten feet. She couldn't see
            anything
            now but the bottom of the window ledge, and the infinite sky on either side of the tower. She looked at the
            stars.
            “How you doing?” she shouted up.</p>
        <p>“Fine,” Tom heaved. He'd never been the most able-bodied and strapping of young men, and he was quite short.
        </p>
        <p>“You're not going to drop me?”</p>
        <p>Tom's answer was short and winded. “Nope.”</p>
        <p>“I'll try and go faster!” she shouted up. “One… two… three!” She jumped, and the rope jolted forward. She
            fell for a
            good five seconds this time, and when she finally halted, the rope tightened around her like a noose.</p>
        <p>She grunted. “Ow!”</p>
        <p>“Sorry!” Tom shouted. “You're getting heavy!”</p>
        <p>“Should I go again?”</p>
        <p>“Rapunzel?” he called.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yeah?”</p>
        <p>“You're almost out of rope.”</p>
        <p>She took a deep breath, and looked over her shoulder. The ground seemed both infinitely far away, and
            reaching up to
            meet her.</p>
        <p>Her head snapped back up. “I'm like halfway. I'm like halfway. I'm like halfway!” she shouted, starting to
            panic.
            “How is this possible? I measured it perfectly!”</p>
        <p>“Well you made a mistake then!”</p>
        <p>“I'll just have to-”</p>
        <p>The rope slipped from Tom's hands. Rapunzel's heart came up her throat as she fell, and she bounced as the
            anchor
            caught the weight. The entire rope hissed as it was pulled tight, Rapunzel suspended in the air.</p>
        <p>She gasped for breath. “What… what the hell was that?”</p>
        <p>“Sorry!” Tom leaned over the ledge, both hands free. His head spun. “That's… very high.”</p>
        <p>Rapunzel looked up at him, furious. “Oh! Is it?? I hadn't noticed!” Her toes clung to the side of the wall as
            she
            clutched the rope in both hands. It suddenly seemed far less sturdy than it had before.</p>
        <p>The noise of the fibres stretching grew louder as Tom eyed it up and down, anchored as it was to the
            fireplace. It
            was visibly vibrating under the pressure.</p>
        <p>“I'll have to climb up, I'll just have to climb back up!” Rapunzel said, forcing herself to think logically.
            She
            pulled on the rope, and it screeched.</p>
        <p>“Rapunzel…” Tom said quietly, fearing even a loud sound might be the thing that caused the rope to snap. “I
            can't
            believe you talked me into this.”</p>
        <p>Rapunzel gulped. “Neither can-” There was the sound of a gunshot, as the rope snapped.</p>
        <p>She screamed, the sky flew up and up and further away and then &#8211;</p>
        <p>#</p>
        <p>Her eyes flicked open.</p>
        <p>She was on her back, and the stars still glittered above her. She wondered vaguely how long she'd been out.
        </p>
        <p>Not long, she figured, if the sun was still not up. She sat up, and touched the back of her head, expecting
            to see
            red when she looked at her fingers.</p>
        <p>It was just water. Her hair was damp from the…</p>
        <p>She rolled over, and ran her hands along the ground. The dirt, cool and damp and inviting. As she massaged
            her
            fingers in it, she fought the urge to rub her face in the ground. She looked out into the woods and saw the
            grass.
            She wanted to cry.</p>
        <p>“Tom!” she shouted. “Tom! It's real! It's all real!” She realised as she said it how silly that sounded
            &#8211; but
            she'd almost convinced herself the world beyond the window was a dream. She lay, flat on the earth, and
            called Tom's
            name again.</p>
        <p>There was no response.</p>
        <p>She sat up. “Tom!”</p>
        <p>Then she gulped. She'd been worried this would happen. That Tom could only exist inside the tower &#8211; or
            that
            once she was free he would die, or disappear, or leave her.</p>
        <p>She felt a small heavy ball in her chest. Twelve years with no one but Tom, and now he was gone. She suddenly
            felt
            six inches tall. “Tom…” she whispered.</p>
        <p>“Yeah?” came a voice behind her.</p>
        <p>Tom was standing at the foot of the tower, like he'd always been there.</p>
        <p>“You're alive!” she said, and she ran to hug her friend but passed straight through.</p>
        <p>“Sorry,” Tom said. He flickered like a candle light. “I need some time to rest. It's harder to, well &#8211;
            do
            anything at all out here.” He doubled over as if he'd been running. “And we're not out of the woods yet.
            Metaphorically or…” he trailed off, looking at the trees.</p>
        <p>They were getting closer.</p>
        <p>He gulped. “Rapunzel, promise me you'll get out of here.” And then he vanished completely.</p>
        <p>She stood up straight. “I will.”</p>
        <p>She'd been so set on getting out of the tower she'd forgotten why it was such a good prison.</p>
        <p>The trees in the Black Forest did not like people.</p>
        <p>#</p>
        <p>Sensing her presence, a few roots had already managed to crawl past the invisible, ten-foot boundary around
            the
            tower. Theoretically, that should be impossible &#8211; but she knew better than anyone that with enough
            patience
            and willpower, there was no boundary that would hold forever.</p>
        <p>She took a deep breath. She had no idea how she was going to get out of here. The Black Forest was a hundred
            acres
            wide, and the tower was right in the centre. The branches wriggled, impatiently. They'd crush her if she was
            caught
            between two of them.</p>
        <p>Well, she thought. I'll just have to be fast.</p>
        <p>She dug her toes into the ground, allowing herself a second to enjoy the sensation of the earth under her
            feet again,
            and then, barefoot, ran headlong into the woods.</p>
        <p>#</p>
        <p>She sprinted, jumping as though on wires, over branches that moved to trip her. She dodged falling liana and
            whipping
            branch alike, and it wasn't long before she realised she couldn't keep this pace up.</p>
        <p>She looked back over her shoulder as she ran &#8211; it looked identical to ahead of her. If she stopped
            running
            she'd end up going in circles.</p>
        <p>Her hands swung in front of her face as she ran, but she could barely even make them out. It was so dark, the
            canopy
            so dense, the full moon's light was completely smothered. There was no sound by her own panting breath, and
            the
            sounds of the trees, stretching.</p>
        <p>She could not stop.</p>
        <p>She would not stop, even though her lungs begged her.</p>
        <p>And then a root, invisible in the dark, darted up and wrapped itself around her ankle.</p>
        <p>She heard the bone snap as she fell, and then, a second later, she felt it. All the nerves in her leg
            screamed in
            agony as she was dragged face-down through the mud, and then hosted into the air by her broken ankle.</p>
        <p>#</p>
        <p>She swung and scratched, and then, when she was completely numb because her leg had screamed itself hoarse,
            she
            thrashed the root that held her until her knuckles bled. It swung her and threw her into the air.</p>
        <p>She landed in a deep pool of water, and opened her eyes.</p>
        <p>It was more blue than anything she had ever seen before. It was like being inside a diamond.</p>
        <p>She could see plumes of red spiralling up in front of her. Blood from her ankle, and her knuckles. On some
            level she
            felt bad, like she was polluting such a pure water source, and then she remembered she couldn't swim.</p>
        <p>She made to swing her limbs, but they were dead weight. But then she realised she was still breathing this
            water as
            though it were air, and relaxed. She closed her eyes, and slept.</p>
        <p>#</p>
        <p>She woke, shivering, by a campfire. She sat up, seeing the trees move and bend, as though they were pressing
            up
            against an invisible shield.</p>
        <p>“They don't like the flames,” she said.</p>
        <p>“They're not crazy about the flames,” came a voice. “They don't like me.”</p>
        <p>It was a man, sitting on the other side of the fire. He was holding a banjo, which he tuned, and wearing a
            silver hat
            with little wings on either side.</p>
        <p>“Where am I?” she asked.</p>
        <p>“You fell in my lake,” he said, busy plucking the D-string of the banjo. It rung out into the forest, the
            only sound
            for miles around. “I had to dig you out.”</p>
        <p>“That was your lake?”</p>
        <p>“It was indeed. Though you seem to have swallowed half of it, given the amount of water you coughed up.” His
            accent
            was unplaceable. She'd never heard anything like it.</p>
        <p>“Thank you for helping me,” she said, and then she remembered everything. Her hands rushed to her ankle,
            expecting to
            find a bloody stump.</p>
        <p>It was untouched, clean. Like the injury had never happened. She looked at her hands, skin like a baby's. “I
            was
            beaten to a pulp,” she said.</p>
        <p>“You know, people search for my lake for their entire lives. And you fall into it by accident.” He strummed
            the
            banjo. It was in tune now. He smiled at the harmony. “Don't often get visitors. You know any good songs?”
        </p>
        <p>This was increasingly surreal. Rapunzel had an odd desire to crawl out of her healed skin. It felt alien. “Am
            I dead?
            Is that what's happening? Is this my brain shutting down?”</p>
        <p>The man laughed. “Far from it, Your Majesty.” He pointed his plectrum at her. “You're gonna go far. I've seen
            it.”
        </p>
        <p>Rapunzel lay down on her back, her head spinning. “Start making sense. Please?”</p>
        <p>“Where's the fun in making sense?” he said. “I had a brother once who made sense. He was trampled by horses.
            Now, I'm
            not going to say one caused the other but…” He gave an exaggerated shrug.</p>
        <p>“Are you touched in the head?”</p>
        <p>The man considered this. “No,” he said eventually. “I don't think so. Just lonely.” He shrugged. “You spend
            too long
            on your own in the middle of a forest, you start going a bit funny. Like…” His tongue rolled around his
            mouth,
            looking for an apt analogy. “A spotty banana.”</p>
        <p>Rapunzel scoffed. “Oh, I can attest to that.”</p>
        <p>He raised a hip-flask. “To going a bit funny.” He took a swig, and threw it to her.</p>
        <p>It tasted like the campfire, and she almost spat it out. “What the hell is this stuff?”</p>
        <p>“Dunno. I just found it.”</p>
        <p>He must be messing with her, she figured. She threw the hip-flask back, and rubbed her eyes with the back of
            her
            hands. “So I should be going,” she said. “Can I borrow a stick of that fire to take with me?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, it'll take a lot more than a stick to get out of here,” the man said. “The trees'll just blow it out,
            and then
            you're a goner.”</p>
        <p>“And what's the alternative?” she asked. “Staying here for the rest of my life and singing camp songs with
            you?”</p>
        <p>“That doesn't sound so bad!”</p>
        <p>Her nose curled. “I'm not sure whether I'd prefer the tower.”</p>
        <p>“Oh yeah! You lived in the tower!” He looked off in another direction, as though he could see it over the
            trees. “I
            bet the view is great from up there.”</p>
        <p>“The novelty wore off after a few years.” She wrapped her arms around her legs.</p>
        <p>“I guess,” he said. “Sing a song! It'll soothe what ails ya!” He strummed his banjo again.</p>
        <p>“Nah,” she said. “I'd better be going.” She stood up.</p>
        <p>“You'll die out there!”</p>
        <p>“I'd rather be a squished banana, than a spotty one.”</p>
        <p>He laughed, from the base of his diaphragm. The firelight reflected in his eyes, and he looked quite mad, and
            very
            happy. “Good luck Rapunzel.”</p>
        <p>She smiled. “How do you know who I am?”</p>
        <p>He tapped his nose, and she suddenly got the impression he was a lot older than he looked.</p>
        <p>She turned away from the warm heat of the fire, and faced the forest.</p>
        <p>“Oh! Rapunzel!” he shouted.</p>
        <p>“What now?”</p>
        <p>He held up a large golden axe. “You forgot this!”</p>
        <p>She raised an eyebrow.</p>
        <p>“I found it next to you on the bottom of the lake. You must have dropped it.”</p>
        <p>She looked at it. It was ornately decorated, very expensive, and looked burnt orange in the fire.</p>
        <p>She shrugged. “I've never seen it before in my life.”</p>
        <p>A grin spread across his face that could've split it in two. “That's the right answer,” he said, and the put
            the axe
            down. From his belt, he pulled another axe. This one was small, and silver, and he threw it at her.</p>
        <p>She caught it in her good hand, looking at it.</p>
        <p>“It's a good luck charm,” he explained. “It only works in the hands of the honest.”</p>
        <p>She looked at it. “What am I supposed to do with it?” It fit in her hand, and the weight was comfortable.
            “It's
            barely big enough to cut bread.”</p>
        <p>His eyes glinted. “Oh, but all the trees fear the axe of an Honest Woodsman. Farewell, Rapunzel.”</p>
        <p>“Thanks…” she started, but then &#8211; “I don't know your name.”</p>
        <p>“Mercury,” he said. And he gave a little salute.</p>
        <p>She nodded, looking down at the little axe. “Thank you Mercury.”</p>
        <p>She turned, and firelight went out like a dying match. When she turned again, there was no fire. No little
            man, no
            lake. Only the trees and the darkness.</p>
        <p>But she could see now. The moonlight reflected off the silver axe and lit the way. The trees quivered.</p>
        <p>She smiled, and she was sure of one thing.</p>
        <p>She had not fallen into that lake by accident.</p>
        <p>And with that happy thought, she started to cut her way out of the forest before the sun came up.</p>
        <p>The world was big, and surprising, and she was going to walk on every square foot of it.</p>
