        <h1>Self-Publishing: The Process</h1>
        <h4>Originally published: July 11th, 2024</h4>

        <div id="navigationbar">

        </div>

        <p>I was asked to give a few bullet points for the practical process of taking a working manuscript and
            self-publishing it. Then I looked up and I had 1300 words, so I'm putting it here for reference.</p>

        <p>It doesn't really touch on the financials of the process other than to point out costs when they appear. I
            might do another one of these if anyone asks. Also, none of this should be taken as legal advice </p>

        <p>(Also, it was originally written for a stranger so if it sounds a bit formal, that's why. lol)</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Getting everything set up to self-publish usually takes about an afternoon, possibly longer if it's your
            first time. It can be very frustrating, and any sites you use are a bit particular, so prepare to be venting
            angry messages in a group chat.</p>

        <p>This will assume you're publishing both an ebook and a paperback, if you're only doing one or the other, you
            can disregard other sections.</p>


        <h2>Getting an eBook file</h2>

        <p>You'll usually want a .ePub file, unless you're selling solely through Amazon Kindle, who accept both ePub
            and their own proprietary format. Below are two ways to get one:</p>

        <h3>Making it yourself</h3>

        <p>An epub file is just a zip file full of text and images, so you can export in that format from a word
            processor.</p>

        <p>If you need further changes (adding an internal cover image if your word processor doesn't add it, any
            formatting changes) you can use a bit of software specifically for editing ePubs. I used one called Sigil
            which was… frustrating, but I didn't need to make many changes so it was fine in the end.</p>

        <p>If exporting from a word processor, it helps to have your chapters marked as headers. (In Microsoft Word,
            this is the Styles pane at the top.) This will ensure the ebook will automatically format it into chapters.
        </p>

        <p>If there's diagrams/images etc throughout the text that may be slightly more complicated if it's not
            automatically handled by the export process. I have no idea as it wasn't an issue for standard novel format.
        </p>

        <p>The easiest way to test if an ePub physically works is to send it to your phone and try opening it in Apple
            Books, or your friendly Android equivalent.</p>

        <p>I do know people who struggled to get this to work. ePub files are bastards, and do not deserve grace. If
            this path turns out to be more trouble than it's worth or is intimidating, another option is:</p>

        <h3>Getting a company to make the ebook for you</h3>

        <p>You can throw a formatted Word file at a service like Reedsy or Draft2Digital and they'll give you more
            control over creating it.</p>

        <p>I can't help with walking you through that but I've had multiple pals who say either service was a fairly
            simple process!</p>

        <h3>Additional note for Scrivener users</h3>

        <p>Whichever of these two paths you're using, if you wrote your manuscript in Scrivener, just have the compile
            dump out a basic double-spaced Word file that you can manipulate yourself in a word processor. The Scrivener
            compile function is a hell you will never escape from.</p>

        <h3>Final note about ebooks</h3>

        <p>Test that your ebook scales to different fonts, font sizes, and dark mode. No-one's e-reader displays the
            same thing so it's worth heading off as many potential issues in advance as possible!</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Creating a paperback file</h2>

        <p>If you're a wizard with Microsoft Word you will probably find formatting paperback easier than the epub file.
            It's just a case of formatting it, I believe every time I've done it I've just followed a YouTube tutorial.
            I think this is the one I used last time and was quite good.</p>

            <div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0IGkyMhsr28?si=nKcsuj05IRzRyL71" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

        <p>A lot of the advice here is to try and avoid 'looking self-published' (eg. awkward spacing or padding on the
            pages or margins, too many words to one page, headers and/or footers which look identical to the body text).
            It's very easy to make your work look 'cheap'.</p>

        <p>If you're looking for professional-looking font(s) that don't look like they came from the word processor, I
            recommend Google Fonts who offer a free license.</p>

        <p>Personally I've noticed no matter how small you think a shortcut is on quality, people do notice. You will
            notice seeing it in person, and you will say “Oh it looks fine!” while knowing deep down everyone else can
            tell. If you're doing print-on-demand paperbacks, just set the final sale price at £1.50 over whatever the
            printing cost is and try to take solace that you're not selling an ugly product.</p>

        <p>(Again if you have images/diagrams in your manuscript, I'm not sure how that plays out so you may need to
            check with the people you publish through.)</p>

        <p>Most sites also accept both .docx and .pdf formats. For the final upload, I would recommend using a PDF. I
            noticed sometimes I would get strange issues with line spacing when using docx which stopped happening when
            I used a PDF.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Selling online</h2>

        <p>You'll likely need an ISBN, which in the UK is regulated by Nielsen
            (https://www.nielsenisbnstore.com/Home/Isbn).</p>

        <p>The first thing you'll notice is that they cost a fortune. The second thing you'll notice is that the pricing
            for a single ISBN is a complete racket, so if you have any inclination that you'll be publishing more than
            one book in your life, just buy a bundle. Different formats will also require their own ISBNs (eg.
            paperback, ebook, hardback, etc), as will future editions.</p>

        <p>Minor changes like the inside leaf with the publishing info or a new cover image do not require a new ISBN.
        </p>

        <p>You may be tempted to share your spare ISBNs with friends etc. (They are expensive after all!) As the ISBN
            declares who the official publisher is, I would advise against it. I remember reading some scary text
            somewhere about losing your rights over the work, and it put me off.</p>

        <p>When selling online there are two main options:</p>

        <h3>Selling through Amazon (also called KDP) exclusively</h3>

        <p><i>(You do not need to give Amazon exclusivity in order to be available on the Kindle Store, but if you
                choose not to make your book Amazon-exclusive, the process for the Kindle Store looks very similar to
                the 'Selling everywhere else' section, so I've separated exclusivity into its own category.)</i></p>

        <p>The easiest way to self-publish is to give your book to Jeff Bezos and let him handle it exclusively. It is
            much quicker, and also lets you optionally skip the pricey ISBN requirement above as Amazon have their own
            numbering system you can opt into.</p>

        <p>I did this for my first release and while I don't regret it, there are definitely downsides to giving Amazon
            exclusivity. Libraries and bookstores won't stock your book without an ISBN, and you will be surprised by
            how many people ask you dejectedly if Amazon is their only option.</p>

        <p>Giving Amazon exclusivity also makes it impossible (or at least, very hard) for you to sell it through any
            other venues in the future.</p>

        <p>If you go this route, you probably don't need a walkthrough as the site itself walks you through the process.
        </p>

        <h3>Selling everywhere else</h3>

        <p>If you're not using Amazon as your sole distributor, you will likely need another distributor service.</p>

        <p>The aforementioned Draft2Digital gets a lot of recommendations. I used IngramSpark. Whichever service you
            use, the most important thing is that you know they get your manuscript on all major sites/services/ebook
            stores, and that they're not region-locked. These sites usually let you give prices in different regions for
            the local currency.</p>

        <p>You can mix and match multiple ebook distributors so long as you use the same ISBN. For example, I distribute
            the same epub file from Amazon KDP directly, and do paperbacks and all other ebook stores through
            IngramSpark. Any aggregate ebook distributor will allow you to switch different services off. If you choose
            to mix and match, make sure no two distributors are selling to the same store.</p>

        <p>Whatever you choose, sites like Goodreads should work all of this out automatically over the course of a few
            days after release.</p>

        <p>Side note, if you're only interested in ebooks, you can theoretically avoid these distributor services and
            handle each store alone but it's a lot of work for very little benefit.</p>

        <p><i>Paperback-only:</i> Whichever service you use, they should let you print a test copy of an uploaded
            paperback file and post it to your house to have a look over. Some of them charge for every time you want to
            make changes, so try and get as much right first time as possible. I don't think you can mix and match
            paperback distributors, but there's not much reason to have two at the same time.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Cover art</h2>

        <p>There are templates on each of the distributor sites for what they expect when it comes to cover art size,
            etc. For ebooks they will give a fixed image size, for paperback the size of the template will vary on the
            size of the pages, and also number of pages as it affects the spine width. They will give you a downloaded
            image to use as a base.</p>

        <p>Whether you pay an artist to make you a cover, or make something in Microsoft Paint is between you and your
            God(s). The cover image, like the text of the book, should (obviously) only contain content that you own,
            have licensed, or are in the public domain.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Other notes for your own sanity</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Give yourself ample time to do all this administrative rubbish without the time pressure of a release
                date. All distributor sites let you set a release date well in the future of you physically uploading
                the files. You don't want to be worried about site uploads, page margins and having all the information
                filled in, while feeling against the clock.</li>
                <li>Setting all this up is incredibly stressful, but usually only needs to be done once. It's worth
                doing it right. (Every time you start this process with a new book, you think it will be easy this time.
                Every time you are proven wrong.)</li>
                <li>Technically if you publish a book with an ISBN you are legally required to submit it to the British
                Library. They have a process for uploading ebooks now which makes it much less of a pain in the arse.
                Just Google it, you can't miss it I don't think anyone will bang down your door, but if you have an
                ebook it's not hard to do.</li>
                <li>If you're only publishing in ebook format, you could bypass this entire publishing process and put a
                PDF on your site behind a paywall. (I am not enough of a tech wizard to know how to do that though.)
                Obviously bookstores/libraries will still be an issue, so it depends what you are aiming for
                distribution-wise.</li>
        </ul>
