            <h2>Have you ever forgotten something important?</h2>

            <p>Holly Winter is jaded, disgruntled and recently unemployed. There's something missing from her life.</p>

            <p>When her flatmate vanishes in a home-made magical ritual, she starts to remember what she's lost.</p>

            <p>Uncovering magic she'd buried away will have Holly using the Glasgow Underground as a banishing circle to
              send a demon back to hell. </p>

            <p>She'll fight with her coven against the Witch Queen of Elf-hame. </p>

            <p>She'll follow a path she's felt on the periphery of her whole life. </p>

            <p>The path of the witch.</p>

            <p>But to uncover those memories, Holly needs the help of a little bookshop in the middle of Trongate.</p>

            <p><b>She needs the Coven of Merchant City.</b></p>
