            <h2>Munro Selkiefolk is dying.</h2>

            <p>Four years ago, Arabella Morrow broke the spell which made her star-crossed love immortal, but miserable. They've been enjoying the time they have left. But now that the years are being measured in hours and minutes, everything is going wrong.</p>

            <p>Old family are coming out of the woodwork, expecting their own resolution. Munro's ex is intent on pushing her way back in. And Munro herself seems to be pushing her away.</p>

            <p>It's on these most harrowing nights of Bella's life, a vampire comes to stay. A vampire who is trying to give up human blood, who was kicked out of her grandfather's cult.</p>

            <p>But now that it's been brought to their attention, exactly what is going on in that mansion at the top of the hill?</p>

            <p>And why is it bending the ley lines of the entire city?</p>

            <p><i>Join the Coven of Merchant City as they enter their darkest chapter yetâ€¦</i></p>
